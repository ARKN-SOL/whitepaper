# What is $ARKN

$ARKN is a digital SPL token (Solana Program Library) built on the Solana network. It operates using smart contracts, which are like digital agreements that automatically execute when certain conditions are met.

$ARKN serves multiple purposes within the Arkenstone ecosystem, including operating the [GemLaunch Suite](../the-gemlaunch-suite/), staking, and receiving airdrops. It's like fuel that powers various activities within the [Arkenstone ](https://arkenstone.gold)ecosystem leading towards increasing demand and the rise of $ARKN price.



## Limited Token Supply

There's a fixed amount of $ARKN available, specifically 4 billion tokens. This scarcity could potentially increase its value over time, similar to how limited edition items become more valuable. Check out our [Tokenomics](../tokenomics.md)
