# Arkenstone is Ecofriendly

Solana utilizes two key algorithms: Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of History (PoH).

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism that replaces energy-intensive mining with a more efficient process. Instead of miners competing to solve complex puzzles, PoS validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to stake. This means that those who have a stake in the network have a vested interest in its security and reliability.

Proof of History (PoH) is a mechanism unique to Solana that efficiently orders transactions without the need for intensive computational work. It uses a cryptographic clock to timestamp transactions, ensuring their integrity and order on the blockchain. This process makes consensus faster and more efficient.

By combining PoS and PoH, Arkenstone which is build on Solana ensures a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to blockchain technology while maintaining security and efficiency.
