# Introduction

## **Challenge**&#x20;

Launching a new token can be either expensive using a 3rd party platform or is a daunting and time-consuming task for many developers and entrepreneurs. Without deep programming knowledge, they must navigate the creation and management of smart contracts, ensure token security and transparency, and integrate with various platforms. Additionally, they face challenges such as efficient token distribution management, compliance with regulatory requirements, and continuous monitoring and adjustment of tokenomics.

## **Solution**

Arkenstone provides an easy-to-use suite including a customizable widget and management panel. Avoid expensive third-party platforms! The ICO Suite will be available as a WordPress plugin, making it even easier to get started that anyone can add to their website to accept crypto payments or create and sell their own tokens, without any coding required and avoid expensive third-party platforms. So in the future even you will be able to create your own token with ease by using GemLaunch Suite.

The suite includes everything you need for the successful launch and operation of a token: from creating and managing smart contracts to an integration in websites, and an intuitive dashboard that provides real-time insights into token performance. With the GemLaunch Suite, you can focus on growing your project while we handle the technical and administrative details without paying insane ammounts to 3rd party Launchpads.
